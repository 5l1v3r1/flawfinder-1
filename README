This is "flawfinder" by David A. Wheeler, <dwheeler@dwheeler.com>.
It's a simple Python program for scanning C/C++ source code
for security problems. It uses lexical scanning to find tokens
(such as function names) that suggest likely problems, estimates their
level of risk (e.g., by the text of function calls), and reports the resutlts.
